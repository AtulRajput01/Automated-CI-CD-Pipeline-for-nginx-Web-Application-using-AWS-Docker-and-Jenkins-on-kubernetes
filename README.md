Certainly! Here is a sample README file you can use as a starting point for your project:

Automated CI/CD Pipeline for nginx Web Application using AWS, Docker, Jenkins, and Kubernetes
This project is an example of how to build an automated CI/CD pipeline for a simple nginx web application using AWS, Docker, Jenkins, and Kubernetes. The pipeline automatically builds and deploys the web application whenever changes are made to the code.

### Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can follow the steps outlined in the Getting Started Guide.


## Architecture Overview

The architecture of the project consists of the following components:

. Web Application: A simple nginx web application that serves a static HTML page.
. Docker: A Dockerfile that defines the containerization of the web application.
. Amazon ECR: A container registry to store the Docker images.
. Kubernetes: A Kubernetes cluster to manage the deployment and scaling of the application.
. Jenkins: A Jenkins instance to build and deploy the Docker images and run automated tests.
